## Plain-Language PM Summary

Paperclip can now send work into Task Hub through the protected live webhook path. Task Hub verifies Cloudflare Access, HMAC signature, source/environment, request id, agent run id, timestamp, and payload contract before creating a Review Queue session.

The important safety rule is still intact: Paperclip-created tasks enter Review Queue as pending work only. They do not create Trello cards, Calendar events, or Google Tasks until a human approves them.

The test/canary items created during live validation have been cleaned safely. They were rejected/archived with audit retained, not deleted and not approved. Runtime count after cleanup is 0 pending / 0 approved / 6 rejected / 0 Trello-linked.

W3-05 adds that operational hardening: PM/QA/Runtime Owner can now inspect live flag status, connection state, source/environment, Review Queue counts, cleanup state, audit categories, and warnings without sending a new canary. It is merged to `dev@2c302dc` and deployed to the dev/demo runtime.

## Parallel Workstream Write Ownership

| File / Area | Write Owner | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `CURRENT_SPRINT.md` | PM only | Dev/QA may read but must not update this file during W1/W2/W3 parallel work. |
| `docs/plans/VERSION_0_2_PARALLEL_WORKSTREAM_PROMPTS.md` | PM only | Preserve prompts for all workstreams; do not delete other workstream prompts. |
| W1 plan/files | W1 Dev / QA | Keep W1 updates inside W1-owned docs/branches until PM checkpoint. |
| W2 plan/files | W2 Dev / QA | Keep W2 updates inside W2-owned docs/branches until PM checkpoint. |
| W3 plan/files | W3 Dev / QA | Keep W3 updates inside W3-owned docs/branches until PM checkpoint. |

Required active W3 branch/worktree:

- Branch: `feature/w3-paperclip-integration`
- Worktree: `trisilar-task-hub-w3-paperclip`

Parallel rule:

- W1/W2/W3 Dev agents must not share one feature branch.
- W1/W2/W3 Dev agents must not run in the same working directory.
- Before editing, each agent must run `git status --short --branch` and confirm the folder/branch match the assigned workstream.
- QA agents report evidence in the workstream handoff/doc, not `CURRENT_SPRINT.md`.
- PM updates `CURRENT_SPRINT.md` after QA pass, PM decision, or integration checkpoint.

## Next Action - V0.2 W3 Monitor / Integration Gate

```text
Role: QA Owner / Runtime Owner
Task: Continue W3 standing dev/demo read-only monitor

Runtime baseline:
dev@2c302dc

Rules:
- Do not send Paperclip webhooks.
- Do not create canary tasks.
- Do not add outbound Paperclip network calls.
- Do not expose secrets, Cloudflare tokens, signing headers, or raw auth values.
- Do not auto-approve Review Queue tasks.
- Do not create Trello cards, Calendar events, or Google Tasks.

Read-only checks:
- PAPERCLIP_WEBHOOK_ENABLED flag state.
- Task Hub /healthz.
- taskhub-dashboard.service.
- paperclip.service.
- Paperclip Settings connection and hasSecret state without exposing the secret.
- Paperclip Review Queue counts: pending, approved, rejected, cleaned, Trello-linked.
- Abnormal webhook/audit warning categories.

Expected output:
- PASS/FAIL.
- Runtime evidence and counts.
- Rollback action if any stop condition appears.
```

**Attribution:** W3-04 cleanup implemented by Codex Dev, QA passed, PM accepted, merged to `dev@7ea4650`, and runtime cleanup executed by Runtime Owner / QA. W3-05 implemented by Codex Dev, reviewed by Codex QA, accepted by Codex PM, merged/deployed at `dev@2c302dc`, and remains under read-only standing monitor.
